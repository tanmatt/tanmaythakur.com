About Me
--------

[![About Me- Tanmay](assets/images/aboutme.jpg)](#aboutme)

I am Tanmay Thakur, a self taught photographer and a software engineer by profession. Challenge me with cool photography projects. Shooting the Northern Lights is on my checklist. I don't own any expensive gear. I have Canon T3i with basic lenses. I prefer to touch up photos in Lightroom.

I would love to hear your views about my work. Let's connect on my [fb page 'Adding Colors to Pixels'](https://www.facebook.com/addingcolorstopixels).
